The programs in this repository are designed to cover a range of topics within bit manipulation, providing practical examples to help you grasp the concepts.

List of Programs
01-set_bit.c: Sets a specific bit in a given integer.
02-clear_bit.c: Clears a specific bit in a given integer.
03-flip_bits.c: Counts the number of bits to be flipped to convert one integer to another.
04-get_bit.c: Retrieves the value of a specific bit in a given integer.
05-rotate_left.c: Rotates the bits of an integer to the left by a specified number of positions.
06-rotate_right.c: Rotates the bits of an integer to the right by a specified number of positions.
