Hash Tables in C Programming
Overview
A hash table, also known as a hash map, is a data structure used in computer science that implements an abstract data type known as an associative array. In order to find the needed value from an array of buckets or slots, a hash table utilizes a hash function to construct an index into each one.

Linked lists and arrays can be used to implement hash tables in C programs. We will store the data in this approach using an array of linked lists. The linked list's nodes each contain a key-value pair. The linked list's associated node is placed at the index determined by hashing the key to create an index in the array.

Usage
To use the hash table, you can follow these steps:

1. Declare a hash table object with a fixed size.

2. Create a hash function that takes a key and returns an index in the array.

3. Define the node structure for the linked list.

4. Implement the hash table functions, including insert, search, and delete

5. Use the hash table in your code by calling the insert, search, and delete functions.

Conclusion 

An effective data structure for associative array implementation are hash tables. Hash tables may be created using linked lists and arrays in C programming. You may make a straightforward hash table implementation in C by following the preceding instructions.
