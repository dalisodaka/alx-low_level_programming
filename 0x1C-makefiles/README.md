C Programming Makefile
This repository contains sample Makefiles for C programming. Makefiles are used to automate the build process of C programs by specifying dependencies between source files and the commands needed to build the final executable. The Makefile makes it easy to compile, link, and test your C code.

Installing the Make Utility
Before you can use the Makefile, you need to install the Make utility on your system. The Make utility is a build automation tool that automatically builds executable programs and libraries from source code. To install Make on your system, follow these steps:

On Linux: If you're using a Linux-based operating system like Ubuntu or Debian, you can install Make using your package manager. Open a terminal and run the following command:

go
Copy code
sudo apt-get install make
This command will install the Make utility and its dependencies on your system.

On macOS: If you're using macOS, you can install Make using Homebrew, a package manager for macOS. Open a terminal and run the following command:

go
Copy code
brew install make
This command will install the Make utility and its dependencies on your system.

On Windows: If you're using Windows, you can install Make using MSYS2, a collection of GNU utilities for Windows. Follow the instructions on the MSYS2 website to install MSYS2, then open a MSYS2 terminal and run the following command:

go
Copy code
pacman -S make
This command will install the Make utility and its dependencies on your system.
